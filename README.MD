# Sound sensor & Arduino

In this project, I will make an Arduino project with lights. The lights will be controlled by sound.

## Summary

For this project, I decided to build a program that people can track how loud a sound is. The materials I used are Arduino, several LED Lights, a sound sensor, and wires. When there is a sound comes out, like speaking or playing music, the LED light will light up. When the sound getting louder, more light will turn on.
This program could use at a library or an environment that require less sound. It will help people to know that their voices are over an average requirement.

## Component Parts

5 5mm LED, 
5 270 Î© Resistors, 
1 Breadboard, 
Arduino Uno, 
sound sensor, 
Jumper wire,  

## Timeline

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Find component parts for the project
- Week 2: Finding outside resources and trying to write the code
- Week 3: Continuing to explore the code and how the circuit connect
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

The hardest is to figure out how to connect the parts together. There was an unexpected situation during the process. I have tried a sound sensor before, but it didn't work. Then I change to another sensor, it works well.
